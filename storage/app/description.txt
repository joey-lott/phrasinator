-- GUARANTEE --

One of the driving forces behind my shop is making people happier. I want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase from me.

If you are not completely satisfied for any reason at all, I will gladly refund your purchase.

Most sellers don't offer refunds on digital products. And I understand why - once you make the purchase, you have access to the product instantly and there's no way to return it to the seller.

But I believe in customer happiness first. So your purchase is completely risk free.

-- HERE'S HOW TO GET YOUR CARD --

1. Add to cart and complete your purchase.
2. Download the PDF file from the link you will receive after you complete your purchase
3. Open the PDF on your computer and print it.
4. Trim along the cut guides. (Optimally, you may wish to use a straight edge and a blade to make the cut.)
5. Fold

That's it! You've got your card.

-- PLEASE NOTE --

The colors of the printed card may appear slightly different than the colors on the screen. That is inevitable due to differences between different monitors and the capacities of different printers.

Have any questions or feedback? Send me a note. I'm always happy to hear from you.

Also, please note that many of my designs are also available on physical products. If you like the design on this card and want to see it on a coffee mug, travel mug, or other product, let me know.
